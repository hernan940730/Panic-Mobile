    DONE: Before you release your application, you need a Google Maps API UID.

    To do this, you can either add your release UID credentials to your existing
    UID, or create a new UID.

    Note that this file specifies the API UID for the release build target.
    If you have previously set up a UID for the debug target with the debug signing certificate,
    you will also need to set up a UID for your release certificate.

    Follow the directions here:

    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/signup

    Once you have your UID (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
